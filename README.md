# PHP_Piscine_Basics

For day 01 of the Piscine, we practiced the PHP on a basic level by making small programs and functions. Here is an explanation of what each of my exercise submissions does. :)

## Ex00 : HW
A small program, quite simple, that greets the world with a famous message.

## Ex01 : mlX
A program that can display 1000 times the letter 'X' followed by a newline. It cannot go over 100 chars.

## Ex02 : to the Divine
A program in that will kindly ask the user for a number. It will inform them if itâ€™s even, odd, or not a number. It must be able to exit with "CTRL-D".

## Ex03 : ft_split
A program that takes a string as an argument and returns a sorted array with the "words" in the string - which are separated by one or more spaces.

## Ex04 : aff_param
A very basic program that displays its command line arguments in the order it has received them - the name of the program is NOT displayed.

## Ex05 : epur_str
A program that takes one unique argument as a string and removes all the spaces at the beginning and at the end of it. It also reduces spaces between each "word" to one single space.

## Ex06 : ssap
A program that displays all the "words" contained in all of its arguments, sorted.

## Ex07 : rostring
A program that takes a string as an argument and displays it with only one space between each word. It places the first "word" (space separated portion of the string) at the end of the string.

## Ex08 : ft_is_sort
A function, which takes an array as an argument and returns "true" or "false" according to whether or not the array is sorted.

## Ex09 : ssap - the return
A program that displays all the "words" contained in all of its arguments, sorted - case insensitive, placing all the characters in alphabetical order first, then numbers, and lastly all the other characters following the ASCII order.
